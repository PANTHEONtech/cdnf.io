				<p class="editable">Services that function in the cloud are characterized by an unlimited presence â€“ they are accessed from anywhere, with a functional connection and are located on remote servers. This can curb costs, as you do not have to create and maintain your servers in a dedicated, physical space. If you do, even more costs can arise from the expertise needed to be built within your company to support such a solution. Cloud-native apps are designed from the ground-up to be present in the cloud and use its potential to the fullest.</p>
