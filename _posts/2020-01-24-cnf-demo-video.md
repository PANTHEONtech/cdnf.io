We will be demonstrating the functionality of three CNF's developed by PANTHEON.tech: DHCP, NAT44 & ACL. All of these cloud-native functions run on top of a Kubernetes cluster, deployed with Contiv / VPP CNI. The demo represents a use-case, where a private customer network provides its client with dynamic, on-demand network services.
